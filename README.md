# ChromeStickies
Chrome Extension that allows the user to add sticky notes to web pages

# Usage

ChromeStickies is a productivity app that allows users to add virtual sticky notes to webpages (stored in local storage). When the user exits chrome, or the webpage, the sticky is still there when the user returns. There is also the option of clicking on the extension icon on the top right and adding static notes in the popup.
